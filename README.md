# Data-Pun-TBD
Basic Data Science "Library"

  + The aim of this repository is to implement a broad range of methods related to data science
  + Develop materials for teaching data science
  + These will hopefully include everything from basic statistics to a number of ML algorithms

This repo was originally created quite a while back. It was never fully realized, but I may soon return to it in order to further investigate data science pedagogy.
